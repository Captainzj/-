During a registration session, the RegistrationController works with one Student, the registrant (i.e., the Student that is registering), and one Schedule, the current Schedule (the Student’s Schedule for the current semester).  These instances need to be accessed by more than one of the RegistrationController’s operations, so Field visibility is chosen from RegistrationController to Student and from RegistrationController to Schedule.  Thus, the relationships remain associations.
