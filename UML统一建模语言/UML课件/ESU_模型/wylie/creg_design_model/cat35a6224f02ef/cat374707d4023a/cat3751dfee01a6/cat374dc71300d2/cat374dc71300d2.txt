The com.odi package contains the design elements that  support the OODBMS persistency mechanism.  The name of the package in the model reflects the naming convention for 3rd party Java software. The convention is to use the reverse of the domain name, so if Rational had a Java package called "util" they’d call it" com.rational.util". This com.odi has nothing to do with Microsoft COM/DCOM, they are totally separate. There is nothing COM/DCOM related when using CORBA, RMI, or ObjectStore.
