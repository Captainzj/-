Responsible for providing access to the persistent objects.
The SampleDBManager is an example of a class an ObjectStore user would write. It is a control class that provides a single entry point into a specific ObjectStore database. The user would add the appropriate operations to the class to access entities in the database. It is often implemented as a singleton, but doesn't have to be (if an application needs to have multiple instances of a database open at once, then each instance would have it's own SampleDBManager). Both solutions would work, it just depends on how you want to do it.
