For our Course Registration System, there is one ObjectStore database,  the Course Registration Database, that contains student and schedule information for the university.
The CourseRegDBManager class is responsible for providing access to the persistent objects in the database (e.g., Student, Schedule, etc.).  It provides a single entry point into the Course Registration Database.
This class will be a singleton as our application only has a single ObjectStore database.
